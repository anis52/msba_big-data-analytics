# Application of House Price Prediction Model on Mortgage Loan Scenario


## 1. Executive Summary

House price prediction is of paramount importance in the banking and finance industry. In the US, banks rely largely on the house appraisal form submitted by individual appraisers to decide the mortgage loan. Yet, our research has found that appraisers’ valuation process might be subjective and biased. This inadequacy creates significant risk and potential loss for banks. In this report, we would stand from the banks’ perspective and aimed to develop an objective tool to assess the true house value and address the conflict by reducing the potential risk and loss induced from the inflated appraisal. 

A scientific machine learning method is developed to estimate the house price. We experimented with 6 Machine Learning methods to train our model and XGBoost is adopted as the best model with the lowest training RMSE of 0.0561. Interestingly, we found that ‘GarageCond’ ranks high in the feature importance and this invites further investigation in the next stage.

By comparing with the bank’s status quo and quantitative simulation, our model could help the bank to reduce 40% proportion of risk they were taking, and the amount of extra risk-free money the bank can earn is at least $1,457,312. This proved that our model can significantly mitigate the risk borne by the bank.
